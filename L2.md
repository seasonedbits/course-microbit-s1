# Agenda

- Revision of L1
- micro:bit board
- micro:bit sensors
  - light sensor
  - temperature
  - magnetometer
  - accelerometer

# We've learnt

--

- "on start" vs "forever"  
  use forever when things change
- show string
- show number
- buttons
- variable
- `if` block

# micro:bit Hardware

- go through the chips on board

# Accelerometer

- measures the acceleration (加速度) of micro:bit
- can also be used to detect inclination (傾斜度)
- we have a constant acceleration towards center of the Earth  
  _due to gravity_
- if we are inclined at different angle, the acceleration will change

# Sleeping micro:bit

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show sleeping icon when facing up
show smiley face when inclined
```

# Tips for Working on

# Embedded Systems

- code _as much as possible_ in MakeCode
- embedded system (嵌入式系統) is slow
- downloading to it takes time
- MakeCode provides an excellent simulator to run code

---

# Saving your Program

- projects saved in the browser  
  reuse on same machine without clearing browser data
- <kbd>Download</kbd> allow you to save the project as `.hex`
- <kbd>Save</kbd> (besides the project name) does similar thing  
  without the dialog for downloading to micro:bit
- the `.hex` is also the program to be put on micro:bit
- import from `.hex`  
  use <kbd>Import</kbd> _or_  
  drag and drop to MakeCode interface

---

# Accelerometer Usage

- Accelerometer is used by smart watch to turn on the screen
- Free fall detection is often used for safety's sake  
  Elevator have accelerometer installed to brake on free fall  
  Monitor elder/children of household incident

]

- we can also access individual LED
- `x` increases from 0 to 4 to the right
- `y` increases from 0 to 4 to the pins
- we often count from 0 in programming  
  so _minus one_ to the value when counting from 1

# Game: Catching eggs

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
create a dot (egg) at top row and falls to bottom
player control dot at bottom row to catch the egg
A button: move the catcher left
B button: move the catcher right
catch 3 eggs to win the game
```

# 1. Falling Eggs

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
create variable `egg`
make it appear at random column on top row
  (x = random(0, 4), y = 0)
make it blink so that it stands out
change its y position by 1 until it reaches bottom
add some sleep before each moves
delete `egg` when it reaches bottom
loop this pattern (`game.gameOver()` will stop the game)
```

# 2. Controlling the Catcher

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
create variable `catcher`
make it appear in middle of bottom row
  (x = 2, y = 4)
use A, B button to change `catcher`'s x value
Game library's "change by" already bound variable to 0 to 4
(remember Counter with Bound?)

# 3. Keeping Score

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
initialize `score` to zero
when `egg` reaches bottom row
check if it overlaps with `catcher` (check if x's are equal)
add `score` by 1 if so
check if `score` equals 3
game over if so
```

# Catching eggs: Challenges

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
Challenge:
deduct score when catcher missed eggs,
  game over when score is -3
increase the game speed whenever an egg is caught
```

# Game: Hatching the egg

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
begin with an egg icon
if temperature reached 25℃, show a hatching egg icon
if egg is hatching, show the creature icon upon shake
design you own icons
hatch others' egg and see their creatures
```

Hint: we need to keep track of the _state_ of the egg

# Programming Concepts

- we used the `state` variable keep track of the _state_ of the egg  
  we can do different things depending on the value of `state`
- 0: show egg while waiting temperature to raise
- 1: show hatching egg while waiting to be shaken
- 2: egg hatched, show monster
- Game library's `score` is a state
- there's no "on temperature" event handler  
  so we have to use "forever" with some sleep

# Conclusion

- micro:bit built-in sensors
- Game library
- how logic is used in games  
  state, if, and, loops
  (the change of time is also a state)
- breaking down a complex problem into [smaller parts](#catching-eggs)
