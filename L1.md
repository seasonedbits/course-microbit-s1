# Introduction

- computing device is part of our daily life
- _computational thinking_ is an effective way to solve problems
- _micro:bit_ is a cheap yet powerful development board
- developed by BBC for computer literacy of school children
- we will use _micro:bit_ board to interact with the physical world

---

# Goals

- **learn to code and code to learn**  
  promote _computer literacy_ and _computational thinking_  
  most child knows how to _consume content_ on computer  
  but not using it as a tool to solve problems (or create games!)
- **physical computing**  
  interact with real world through software you wrote
- **applications of computing**  
  learn how everyday products are made
- **boost creativity**
- **have fun**

# Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

- computation capability of microcontroller has been catching up
- size of microprocessor has been going down
- the distinction may now be artificial and not meaningful anymore
- also, most systems consist of both

# Playing with MakeCode

- [Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)
- there are tutorials and sample project on landing page  
  we'll not be using them for now
- create a new project
- on the far left is a micro:bit simulator  
  you program can be run on the simulator
- then we have blocks for us to program

---

# Let's check the blocks

- block categorized by feature (called module/package)
- go through blocks in "Basic"  
  click "more" to show more "Basic" blocks
- viewing documentations
  1. mouse hover on the block
  2. Right Click -> Help
- [Reference - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference)

---

# Types of blocks

- we can also classify blocks by how they behaves
- statement
- value
- boolean value (true/false)
- event handler/listener

--

- note they have different _shapes_
- check blocks in "Loops" and "Logic"  
  what are they?

---

# Showing string

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show you name on LED screen
```

]

- use "on start" or "forever"?

---

# Buttons

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show "A" on LED screen when A button is pressed
show "B" on LED screen when B button is pressed
```

]

- Keyboard shortcut for
  - Delete <kbd>Del</kbd>
  - Copy and Paste <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>
  - Undo <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>

---

# Polling vs Event Handling

- `input.onButtonPressed(Button.A)` vs `input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A)`

--

- `onButtonPressed()` register an event listener  
  micro:bit can do other works while waiting for the event
- checking `buttonIsPressed()` in `forever()`  
  is what we called a _busy loop_  
  we should avoid them, or at least add some pause between the loop

???
analogy of waiting for you favorite TV show, you'll wait for the theme song rather than checking the TV every second

---

# Make a Counter

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show a counter on LED screen
the counter starts with 0
increase counter by 1 when A button is pressed
decrease counter by 1 when B button is pressed
```

]

- we need to store the counter as a _variable_ (變量)
- which blocks to use?

# Saving your Project

- projects saved in the browser  
  reuse on same machine without clearing browser data
- <kbd>Download</kbd> allow you to save the project as `.hex`
- <kbd>Save</kbd> (besides the project name) does similar thing  
  without the dialog for downloading to micro:bit
- the `.hex` is also the program to be put on micro:bit
- import from `.hex`  
  use <kbd>Import</kbd> _or_  
  drag and drop to MakeCode interface

---

# Tips for Working on

# Embedded Systems

- code _as much as possible_ on PC
- embedded system (嵌入式系統) is slow
- downloading to it takes time
- MakeCode provides an excellent simulator to run code

# Dot Matrix

.col-7[
.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show a heart on screen
(micro:bit loves you)
```

# Dot Matrix

.row[
.col-5[
![](./images/microbit/dot_matrix.png)
]

.col-7[

```
+--------------------------> x
| (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0)
|
| (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1)
|
| (0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2)
|
| (0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3)
v
y (0,4) (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4)
```

]

- `x` increases from 0 to 4 to the right
- `y` increases from 0 to 4 to the pins
- we often count from 0 in programming  
  so minus one to access the LED when counting from 1

# Blinking LED

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
turn on LED at (2,2)
turn off LED at (2,2)
loop this pattern
```

]

- browse through the blocks in "LED" to see what's useful

--

.footnote[
Hints:

- there are multiple ways, try `plot()`/`unplot()` and `toggle()`
- micro:bit is blinking too fast, slow it down so we can see
  ]

.col-6[
.img-100[
![](./images/blocks/blinking_led_2.png)
]
]
]

- there's more than one way to archive the goal
- micro:bit is blinking too fast  
  we have to add sleep so we can see

---

# Turn on LED 1 by 1

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
turn on LED one at a time
from left to right, top to bottom
```

]

--

- the dumb way

--

- use loops

---

# Loops

- notice the "from ... to" in our plan  
  this suggest use of loop
- go through blocks in "Loops"
- remember the range for indexing [Dot Matrix](#dot-matrix)

---

# Breathing LED

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
LED at (2,2) start from dim and glows
loop this pattern
```

]

- browse through the blocks in "LED"
- also check "more"

---

# Breathing LED

]
]

.col-6[
.img-100[
![](./images/blocks/breathing_led_2.png)
]
]
]

- note the trick of `led.setBrightness(0)` before drawing
- we also have to add sleep, otherwise the LED is just blinking

---

- How to "exhale" (dimming the LED gradually)?

--

- What's the difference?
  - `led.plotBrightness(x, y, brightness)`
  - `led.setBrightness(brightness)`

---

# Breathing Heart

- animating heart  
  [Flashing Heart - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/flashing-heart)  
  `microbit-breathing-heart.hex`  
  note the added sleep of 1ms, otherwise matrix will flicker
- animating faces  
  [blink blocks challenges - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/blink/challenges)  
  `plot()` and `unplot()`
- [night light challenges - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/night-light/challenges)  
  set brightness of built in LED, make it breathe
- [Plot Acceleration - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/examples/plot-acceleration)  
  plot x-t, then y-t with `led.plotBarGraph()`
