# Agenda

- Introduction
- Computing Devices
- Play with MakeCode

name: intro

# Introduction

- computing devices is part of our daily life
- _computational thinking_ is an effective way to solve problems
- _micro:bit_ is a cheap yet powerful development board
- developed by BBC for computer literacy of school children
- we will use _micro:bit_ board to interact with the physical world

---

# Goals

- **learn to code and code to learn**  
  promote _computer literacy_ and _computational thinking_  
  most child knows how to _consume content_ on computer  
  but not using it as a tool to solve problems (or create games!)
- **physical computing**  
  interact with real world through software you wrote
- **applications of computing**  
  learn how everyday products are made
- **boost creativity**
- **have fun**

# Course Format

- **Components, Technology and Theory**

--

- **Make**  
  build the hardware circuit  
  _on upcoming lessons_

--

- **Code**  
  form problem statement (describe the problem)  
  plan on how to solve problem  
  programming: actual coding

--

- **Discussion**  
  what the application of the technology is

---

# Playing with MakeCode

- [Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
- there are tutorials and sample projects on landing page  
  we'll not be using them for now
- create a new project and enter the editor

# Let's check the blocks

- blocks are like LEGO, they snap together
- block categorized by feature (called _package_ or _library_)
- go through blocks in "Basic"  
  click "more" to show more "Basic" blocks
- viewing documentations
  1. mouse hover on the block
  2. Right Click -> Help
- [Reference - Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference)

---

# Types of blocks

- we can also classify blocks by how they behaves
- statement
- value
- boolean value (true/false)
- event handler/listener

--

- note they have different _shapes_
- check blocks in "Loops" and "Logic"  
  what are they?

---

# Showing string

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show you name on LED screen
```

]

- use `basic.showString()`
- put it in "on start" or "forever"?

---

# Buttons

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
show "A" on LED screen when A button is pressed
show "B" on LED screen when B button is pressed
```

]

- Right click on block for actions
- Keyboard shortcut for
  - Delete <kbd>Del</kbd>
  - Copy and Paste <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>
  - Undo <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>

# Polling vs Event Handling

- `input.onButtonPressed(Button.A)` vs `input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A)`

--

.img-100.center[
![](./images/blocks/button.png)
]

- `onButtonPressed()` register an event listener  
  micro:bit can do other works while waiting for the event
- checking `buttonIsPressed()` in `forever()`  
  is what we called a _busy loop_  
  we should avoid them, or at least add some pause between the loop

???
analogy of waiting for you favorite TV show, you'll wait for the theme song rather than checking the TV every second

# Make a Counter

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
create a counter that starts with 3
show the counter on LED screen
decrease counter by 1 when A button is pressed
increase counter by 1 when B button is pressed
```

]

- we need to store the counter as a _variable_ (變量)
- which blocks to use?

# Make a Counter: Advanced

.blockquote[
.title[Coding Plan]

```
based on counter
limit the counter to 0-5
```

Hint: use `if`

# Conclusion

- introduced to some common computing devices
- coding in MakeCode
- we can do a lot just using the simulator in MakeCode
