# Metric Prefixes

- in science and engineering, we sometimes deal with .xlarge[very big] and .xsmall[very small] quantities
- it's troublesome to write and keep track of the zeroes before and after decimal points
- we use prefixes to scale up and down the quantities
- you've already seen some of those
